Thank you for downloading BYUâ€™s Wordpress Template. 

Child Theme:

Make sure to create a child theme. If modifications are made to this parent theme and not in a child theme, they will be overwritten when the theme gets updated. Here is a link to the wordress codex on how to create a child theme: http://codex.wordpress.org/Child_Themes

Plugins:

There are several plugins that make this theme more functional that will need to be downloaded. They are:

-Single Post Template

-New RoyalSlider (Purchased Plugin) - If not authorized, use your own slider plugin

-Git-Hub Updater Plugin: https://github.com/afragen/github-updater

Notes:

-The front page calendar uses the BYU RSS feed. The feed can be found at http://calendar.byu.edu/Rss/Export/. Adding an additional integer 
 at the end will give you a specific department. For example, calendar.byu.edu/Rss/Export/7 will give the BYU Speeches and Devotionals RSS feed.
